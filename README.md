# SwiftUI Views and Modifiers

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to exploring two fundamental components of SwiftUI: **views** and **modifiers**. , Learning to build custom view modifiers and containers, deepening the understanding of SwiftUI's internal workings.

## Topics Covered
1. **Views and Modifiers: Introduction**  
   - A beginner-friendly overview of what views and modifiers are in SwiftUI.

2. **Why Does SwiftUI Use Structs for Views?**  
   - Explanation of SwiftUI's choice to use structs instead of classes for views, including benefits like immutability and performance.

3. **What Is Behind the Main SwiftUI View?**  
   - Understanding what happens behind the scenes when a SwiftUI view is created.

4. **Why Modifier Order Matters**  
   - Exploring how the order of modifiers affects view rendering and behavior.

5. **Why Does SwiftUI Use “Some View” for Its View Type?**  
   - The role of opaque return types in SwiftUI and their impact on view composition.

6. **Conditional Modifiers**  
   - How to apply modifiers conditionally and the best practices for dynamic styling.

7. **Environment Modifiers**  
   - A deep dive into environment modifiers and their cascading effects on child views.

8. **Views as Properties**  
   - Leveraging views as properties to build modular and reusable components.

9. **View Composition**  
   - Techniques for composing complex user interfaces from smaller, reusable views.

10. **Custom Modifiers**  
    - Step-by-step guide to creating your own view modifiers to encapsulate styling and behavior.

## Key Learnings
- **Structs and Immutability**: Understand why SwiftUI’s design is based on structs.
- **Modifier Effects**: Learn how modifier chaining and order influence your UI.
- **Custom Modifiers**: Create reusable custom modifiers for cleaner and more maintainable code.
- **SwiftUI Internals**: Gain insights into how SwiftUI operates under the hood.
